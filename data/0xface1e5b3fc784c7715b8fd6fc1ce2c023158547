  "description": "DALL-E Punks or Dunkz is an experimental NFT collection created and rendered on a custom AI stack built from reverse engineering DALL-E, a text-to-image AI art generator.\n\nEach Dunk takes inspiration from their corresponding original CryptoPunk, directly referencing the metadata and rendering traits in further detail, whilst continuing to honour and pay homage to the ethos of the OGs and the design philosophy behind them.\n\nDunkz is the first PFP collection where all NFTs share common likeness but are entirely unique, bringing attention to the diversity of the global Web3 community greater than any project that has come before.",
