  "description": "Anata NFT is a brand new form of NFT identity. It's the first NFT you can literally be. Anatas use your webcam or phone camera to mimic your movements exactly. When you speak, your Anata speaks. When you blink, your Anata blinks. Move your head back and forth, raise your eyebrows, squint your eyes â€” it's all reflected immediately by your Anata. Each Anata is bundled with a set of emotes so you can be extremely expressive. Fire eyes, anger, peace signs, shame, heart eyes, and more.",
