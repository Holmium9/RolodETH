  "description": "The PUMA Nitro Collection is the digital twin to the physical NFRNO and Fastroid shoes that can be claimed with PUMA Materializer NFT in 2023.\n\nBoth designs were developed with the metaverse in mind. Designed first in 3D and tested in augmented reality before physical samples were ever created. The physical products are a first-of-their-kind experiment with new materials, technology, and design.\n\nHolders of the PUMA Nitro Collection will receive premier access to future PUMA projects in the web3 and metaverse space.\n\nMaterializer: https://opensea.io/collection/materializerpuma",
