  "description": "[MetaGravity](https://www.metagravity.com/) | [Edge of Chaos](https://www.edgeofchaos.io/) | [Retro Arcade](https://retroarcadenft.com/)\r\n\r\nRetro Arcade is the Genesis NFT collection from MetaGravity Studio featuring an innovative new type of “SmartNFT” on the Ethereum blockchain. This now serves as both a collectible PFP Avatar and FREE MINT PASS for our upcoming SmartNFT game. Retro Arcade Gen 1.0 holders will also unlock whitelist access to future MetaGravity ecosystem projects.\r\n\r\nRetro Arcade Gen 1.0 was originally a FREE WL MINT proof-of-concept and tech demo. It demonstrated retro DOS games (and even the Windows 95 OS) running on Opensea as an interactive, playable NFT. The tech demo represents the pinnacle of decentralisation where the on-chain NFT and its machine code (hosted on IPFS) are fully decentralised and executable. This innovation will feature extensively in Gen 2.0 NFTs.",
