  "description": "The collection of 10k Drunk Ass Dinos (DADs) was randomly, programmatically generated from millions of possibilities. DADs currently reside on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of ERC-721 tokens and are hosted on IPFS. DADs have varying traits across categories like dino type, body color, skin, eyes/eyewear, headgear, outfits, and hand props!  \n\nVisit us at https://www.drunkassdinos.com/ and follow us at https://twitter.com/drunkassdinos for more info!",
