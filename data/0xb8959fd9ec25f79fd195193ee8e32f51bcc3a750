  "description": "Pixel Blossom is a slow-burn NFT collection that aims to offer an alternative to the mainstream of NFTs, ruled by hype and FOMO.\n\nThe Genesis drop features 12 established crypto artists, each of whom created a unique, never-before-seen artwork. The artworks are limited edition NFTs that reveal over the course of 21 days, pixel-by-pixel in front of the collectors' eyes.\n\nPixel Blossom wants to advocate that even in this high-paced world of crypto, \"great art is worth waiting for\". After all, it was artists that started the current NFT revolution - let's take a moment to celebrate them!",
