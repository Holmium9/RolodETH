  "description": "The Everyones by award-winning British artist Ian Murray, makes history as the “FIRST EVER” collection minted by House of First. \r\n\r\nThese 2,500 NFTs are inspired by the seemingly ordinary, using bold graphic mid-century-tinged visual language to create one-of-a-kind characters with a sense of warmth and quirky nostalgia. The characters are not super models, they are geeks and nerds, a bit vulnerable, and a bit whimsical, yet at the same time entirely loveable - aren't we all?\r\n\r\nJoin our discord to unlock exclusive benefits: https://discord.gg/houseoffirst",
