  "description": "[Minting Now:](https://opensea.io/collection/runi/drop) Introducing the very first generative NFT for the popular Splinterlands game! With thousands of active players across the world, Splinterlands is heralded as one of the great pioneers in play-to-earn blockchain gaming. Be part of history by minting a unique one-of-a-kind Legendary character that will be playable within the game!  \n\nThe Riftwatchers have shared the secret for creating magical constructs that are powered by rune-enchanted cores. These floating golems are called Runicore, otherwise known as \"Runi\". Battle Mages like you now have the opportunity to craft a Runi of their own. Junkers have been sent out to collect the necessary components. Rune Crafters and Technomancers are preparing the assembly areas.  \n\nWhat kind of Runi will you create?",
