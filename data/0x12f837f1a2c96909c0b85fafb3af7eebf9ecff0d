  "description": "Inspired by Seattle’s iconic Gas Works Park, abstract expressionism, and early computer generated art, #FiatWorks plays with notions of homage, ruins, time, and the natural decay and evolution of fiat currency — while nodding to the post-fiat future. The project was commissioned by CoinList and is created by artist Case Simmons. The first 3,000 were gifted to CoinList users that accumulated the highest CoinList Karma score from 2021's eligible categories.\n\nYou can find Case Simmons on Twitter: @CgsYop",
