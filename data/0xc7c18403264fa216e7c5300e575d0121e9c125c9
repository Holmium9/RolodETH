  "description": "In the 1980's a gritty British band, The Fated, exploded onto the European scene. Outplaying and out partying their better known counterparts, The Fated toured recklessly to sold out crowds. Unwilling to have their music defined by any one recording, they refused to release an album. Preferring instead to leave their legacy in the hands of their rowdy fans, appropriately nicknamed the Renegades. After an extended break theyâ€™re back where it started for a one night only special event, presented by Neon Tusk. It will kickstart an adventure nobody will ever forget.",
