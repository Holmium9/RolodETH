Olympus grow the fungi of the gods: MUSHROHMS\r\n\r\nMeditating in infinite ohming bliss, these enlightened creatures will one day reach down from the mountaintop to change the consciousness of this world and beyond!\r\n\r\nJoin the movement by becoming a Shrohmie and participating in future Mushrohm events like cross-chain sporedrops, collaborations, community POAPs, and more!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: All 1st Gen Mushrohms will soon be able to enter the reversible Transmutation Bridge to the Arbitrum Network.
