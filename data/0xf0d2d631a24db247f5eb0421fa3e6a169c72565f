  "description": "Meet a very special group of small, spiny mammals who love nothing more than trading perpetuals. Each of the 4,200 Hedgies will make its way home to a trader, voter, or supporter of the dYdX community. Each user holding a Hedgie will also receive a one tier increase in $DYDX fee tier discount on the dYdX protocol. Hedgies will be subject to the Hedgies License Agreement, a license that gives rights as close as possible to full ownership of every aspect of Hedgies to Hedgie owners: https://dydx.exchange/hedgies-license-agreement.",
