  "description": "What The Phunks is your ultimate Alpha aggregating [Discord group](https://discord.gg/eyvZAurMY5). We purchase and access expensive Alpha/Bluechip groups and relay all that phunking info to our WTP holders. No longer will Alpha be restricted to whales because WTP is changing the game! \n\nWe will work to free the Alpha for all the phunkers!\n\nBy holding a WTP you will have exclusive access to calls and information that is normally gated in private/paid Discords! We started with Moonbirds, Champs Only, Metaverse HQ, Aqua Tools but now you'll have insights into Bluechips like BAYC, Azuki, Kaji and so much more!\n\nYou must hold at WTP to be view our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eyvZAurMY5)",
