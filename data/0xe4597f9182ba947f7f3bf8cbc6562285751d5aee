  "description": "With a cyberpunk aesthetic set in the dystopian future city of Cryptopolis, the first NFTs on SuperFarm are aptly named the Genesis Series. These NFTs are packed with utility across the SUPERVERSE, and will entitle their holders to unique privileges and unlock new experiences. Holders of these NFTs will enjoy key platform utilities such as priority whitelist access, farming multipliers, access to in-game items and more.\r\n\r\nThere are five unique characters that will be released during the Genesis Series Drop. If you **collect all five designs you will receive a free NFT collectorâ€™s trophy**, airdropped to your account at a later date. To get this NFT collector award you must be holding all five characters in the same wallet on 12:01AM PST April 20th, 2021. **Holders of these NFTs are also eligible for SUPER airdrops that vary based on rarity.**"
