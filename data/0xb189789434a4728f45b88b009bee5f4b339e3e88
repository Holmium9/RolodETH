  "description": "Aswang Tribe is a collection of 3333+ utility-infused NFTs inspired by Filipino mythology.\n \nThis vastly diverse set of profile picture art gives you access to a one-of-a-kind digital collectibles ecosystem that features Day 1 Staking, Day 1 Breeding, and one of the most wildly creative communities in web3.\n \nEach Aswang is designed to gain \"Prayer Levels\" the longer you stake. The highest Prayer Level can only be earned by staking for 333 years - a true test of the promises of blockchain tech that puts the spotlight on one of its most overlooked usecases: cultural preservation.\n \nThis collection contains 1111 Tikbalang (badass horses), 1111 Siyokoy (chad fish guys), and 1111 Duwende (qt mushrooms) that will soon be joined by 3333 Manananggal (demon e-girls).\n \nFind the Aswang that speaks to your soul.\n \nJoin the Tribe.\n \n!pray üëÅÔ∏è",
