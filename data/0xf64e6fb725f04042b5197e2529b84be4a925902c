  "description": "Welcome to ZenAcademy. These tokens grant lifetime membership to our sanctuary in this crazy NFT world. I encourage anyone interested in joining to visit https://zenacademy.gitbook.io and read all about the memberships -- here is a snippet from there: \n\nMy goal with ZenAcademy is to create a community of like-minded individuals that are here to learn, that are here to share, create, build, encourage. I don’t want it to be a place where one person is going to post “alpha calls” and get an army of followers to fomo into projects. I want it to be a place where we all help one another, by learning. I want to research projects and share what I think and then get feedback from everyone else and hear what you think too. I’m one tiny cog in this enormous wheel. I just hope to move the wheel forward, and I hope that some of you will join me and move the wheel forward with me.\n\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/zenacademy",
