  "description": "XOXO is Maya & Yehuda Devir’s lifetime project. Always eager to create and innovate, the decision to transcend their art to the Blockchain simply made sense. XOXO is the Devir's natural evolution in the art world from the past to the future, containing within it the real secret to the genius behind their work: their relationship. The collection confronts relationships head-on with humor, vulgarism, and cynicism, as it challenges the discussion around our basic social needs as human beings in relationships. The collection holds 101 original XOXO’s which fabricate 10,000 unique pairs, with different levels of rarity. There is a unique story behind each couple and a specific structure to each XOXO token.\n\nCheck out our Genesis collection \n[XOXO LoveStories](https://opensea.io/collection/xoxolovestories)\n",
