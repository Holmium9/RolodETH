  "description": "Each year Silks tokenizes the annual U.S. crop of approximately 20,000 registered thoroughbred racehorses into digital collectibles. When you purchase a Silks racehorse you can earn valuable rewards based on the racing and breeding performance of their real-world counterparts throughout the horses’ 20+ year lives. The trajectory of the underlying horses’ development and their success over the course of their racing and breeding careers shapes the demand and future value of these digital collectibles. You can fractionalize and share ownership of their horses with others by forming syndicates within the game. You can also acquire and develop land into horse farms which operate as gamified businesses that generate revenue and allow you to share winnings and offset risk through collaborative racing pools.\n\nBuy Avatars: https://www.silks.io/promo\nBuy Yearling Pass: https://www.silks.io/racehorses",
