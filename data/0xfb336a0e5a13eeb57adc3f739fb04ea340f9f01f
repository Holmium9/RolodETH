  "description": "Wize Fellaz Bronze Edition is a collection depicting a secret society of elderly superheroes who have been fighting the forces of chaos since the beginning of time by harnessing the power of Spring Tea, a wondrous cocktail that prolongs life, grants supernatural powers, and drives users slightly kooky. Our collection capitalizes on the incredible power of original art and storytelling to build a vibrant Web3 brand.\n\nBeyond financial growth and sustainability, our community seeks to support institutions that improve the lives of older adults suffering from poverty and social exclusion.\n\nJoin us on Twitter @wizefellaz and the web at https://www.wizefellaz.com",
