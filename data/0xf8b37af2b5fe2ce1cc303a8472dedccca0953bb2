  "description": "HENI is delighted to present The Great Expectations NFT collection which contains 10,000 unique artworks made by Damien Hirst. Following on from the artwork that he created for Drake's album cover, the NFTs show grids of emoji-like pregnant women whose forms have been constructed from spots of various shapes, sizes and colors taken directly from The Currency artworks themselves. The NFTs were airdropped to holders of The Currency, Damien Hirst's first NFT collection.\r\n\r\nThe collection is on the Palm blockchain, which is a new token-powered ecosystem for NFTs connected to Ethereum. It is 99% more energy efficient than proof of work systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. The Great Expectations NFTs can be moved to Ethereum.",
