  "description": "At the end of 2021, Metalink released NFT Wrapped - a campaign to commemorate your NFT year in review... For those brave enough to make it to the end of the experience, there was the option to save this piece of NFT history. They could either \"right click save as\" or mint. Little did the minters know the journey to ensue in the months and years to come... The future is being revealed everyday. âš¡\n\nSee you in the Metalink. ðŸ‘¾",
