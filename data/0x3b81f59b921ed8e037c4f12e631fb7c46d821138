  "description": "Prime Dragon Planet is our most anticipated drop in the Prime Planet Ecosystem yet! Meticulously crafted and sculpted by our ultra-talented artist - Kurtis Dawe, the “Scale Man”! Known for making dragons and monsters for movies like Godzilla and The Eternals. It is the third collection of the Prime Planet series and there are 6,969 Primus Reptiles that were believed to be extinct. It is still being investigated how exactly they returned to existence.",
