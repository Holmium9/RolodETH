  "description": "In every real goblin we can see a bit of ourselves, each with their own stories and internal struggles. So we curated this art to find a collection of people who found themselves within the poetry of brush strokes. Join us as we embark on a different discovery path than standard NFT trodding, creating something new, innovative, and beautiful.",
