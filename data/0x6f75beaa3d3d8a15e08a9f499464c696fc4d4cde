  "description": "LIT Squiggle Game is a reimagining of the original loved mobile game the Nokia Snake Game. \n\nWe wanted to bring Snake game into the future and just as the Snake game signaled a new era in mobile gaming, Snowfro, his incredible team and cohort of amazing artists at Artblocks has ushered in a new era of onchain artistic and cultural expression. Through this game we celebrate them both. \n\nJust like Nokia, LIT Squiggle Game is designed especially for mobile. Right from your Opensea account. \n\nPlease head over to the official LIT Discord or Twitter account to learn more about how to play and get involved with the LIT Squiggle Game Challenge.",
