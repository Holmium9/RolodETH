  "description": "polys.art resulted from a search for the highest beauty with the fewest bits\r\n\r\nour art uses only up to 70 regular polygons placed on a canvas, which is very low data, but surprisingly is able to create some really interesting images\r\n\r\nwe're 100% stored and rendered on-chain\r\n\r\nmore info about our thoughts on the present and future of on-chain art can be read here:\r\ntinyurl.com/polys-art",
