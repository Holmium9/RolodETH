  "description": "OVR created a digital layer over the physical world made of 300 sqm hexagons, the OVR Lands. There are over 1.6 trillions of those covering the planet, each one has specific coordinates and unique name. OVRLand is a tokenized Spatial Web Domain. Thanks to GPS and Computer Vision the OVR app will deliver you AR experiences contextualized to your geographic position. The OVR Land owners will have the power to decide which content will be shown on their geographic location.",
