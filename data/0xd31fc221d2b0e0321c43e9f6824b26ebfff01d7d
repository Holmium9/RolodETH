  "description": "\"In-chain\" generative art, Brots were the first bitmaps to be generated and rendered entirely by a blockchain contract. No externalities, no rendering dependenciesâ€”just 100% Solidity.\n\nCollectors can experiment with different colour palettes on our [site](https://brotchain.art/color-editor.html), before committing their favourite to the blockchain to update their piece.\n\nYou can hear creators, Arran and Harri, talking about the project with Kevin Rose on his NFT podcast [PROOF](https://www.proof.xyz/brotchain-generative-art-built-entirely-on-blockchain/)",
