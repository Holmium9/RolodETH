  "description": "The sketchiest comic apes on the blockchain, the Sketchy Ape Comic Club NFT Collection symbolizes the merging of the physical world and the digital. Each ape was hand-drawn by the artist in separate layers and then ran through the HashLips Art Engine to generate 10 000 unique and very special apes.\n\nThese amazing hand-drawn \"Ape Art Masterpieces\" are not only awesome fine art PNGs to own, but itâ€™s also an exclusive Sketchy Ape Book Club membership that gives access to members-only benefits which will be revealed over time.",
