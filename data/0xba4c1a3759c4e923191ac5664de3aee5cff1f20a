  "description": "Register your own .wrld name now: https://wrld.name\r\n\r\nWRLD Name Service (WRLDNS) names are both a gamertag compatible with all metaverses and a secure, decentralized domain name. WRLDNS names provide a way for metaverses, web3 games/projects to assign and track player achievements and game related data specific to their WRLDNS name. Think of them as a singular account identity for all the metaverses/web3 games you might play in the future. They also operate as a way to map human readable names to blockchain and non-blockchain resources.\r\n\r\nWRLDNS names are designed to be cross chain - in the future supporting name ownership, data and record propagation across all major EVM based chains such as Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and more.",
