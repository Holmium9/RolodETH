  "description": "The Happies™   |   Free Mint   |   All Art Created with Microsoft Paint   |   CC0  \n\nThe year is 2022. The world has been thrown violently into a bear market; tensions are at an all-time high and depression in the crypto and NFT space is bubbling under the surface.\n\nThen, in the darkest of blockchain despair comes a spark of joy. One little flame that burns brightly and catches wind. That little spark of joy brings hope to a fallen world and restores color and vibrancy, reminding the world that there is still something to be joyful about. \n\nEnter: The Happies; an entire collection build around goofy, happy-go-lucky characters saturated in joyful bliss and encouragement. If you’re looking for a P2E game, look elsewhere. If you’re after a Metaverse experience, move along. But if you want that spark of joy in your collection, then look no further.\n\n\\#behappie \\#happiefamily\n\nhttps://thehappies.io\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HappieFamily",
