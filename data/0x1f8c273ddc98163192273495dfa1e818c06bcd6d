  "description": "The Skeletonz Gang is a fun loving community run initiative and the Underverse is where we rest our bones. \nBy breeding of two Genesis you can bring to life next generation of little rascals - [Skellies](https://opensea.io/collection/skeletonz-gang-skellies) \n\nOur official website is: skeletonzgang.com\n\nPHASE 1: 666 Genesis Skeletonz is SOLD OUT\n\nThis is the Genesis Collection, and these are the settlers of the Underverse. Genesis Skeletonz are given exclusive access and are tasked with kickstarting society by populating the next generation through breeding. There are only 1500 of these completely unique and oddly friendly members. Do you have what it takes to rattle with us?",
