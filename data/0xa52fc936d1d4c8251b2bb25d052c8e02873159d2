  "description": "What have you done Morick ??!!\n\n\nYear is 2077. Covid is still here. Governments have banned NFTs. \nLoving his dimension too much to change, Morick decides to merge it with one without covid and where NFTs are the main economy. \nUnfortunately, things didnâ€™t go as expected. In this new ultra dimension, Picasso ends up being the creator of Kawai.\n\nNew World Order is an attempt by iwwon to bring generative art to a new level, one that will vibrate with traditionnal art and hopefully motivate more artists and non-believers to join this revolutionary movement that is happening with crypto and NFT.\n\n",
