  "description": "**MINTING IS CURRENTLY LIVE AT [DEADAVATARS.COM](https://deadavatars.com)** \r\n\r\nCreated by YouTube Channel \"NerdCity\": The Dead Avatar Project is a generative art series with 10,000 unique skulls who will live forever on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be featured in an upcoming TryHards series that aims to help creators of all kinds mint and market their tokenized art; to add value and utility to their NFTs; and to build new communities that will stand the test of time regardless of crypto's inevitable ups-and-downs or swings in speculative trading (\"WGMI!\"). The Dead Avatar Project is part of a grand experiment that will begin to unfold for Youtube viewers in a few months. The D.A.P. also launches with skulls that feature the likenesses and rare traits of many well-known collaborators and friends within the Youtube community.  But which skull is yours?  You are invited to be part of this part of strange and wild blend of entertainment and technology!",
