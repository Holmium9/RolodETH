  "description": "Filaments is infinitely animated. If you left it running for 100 years, it'd still show you something unique.\n\nYou can make a Twitter banner (or profile pic background, etc) with it at the press of a button.\n\nAll trait generation is on chain (no contract callers) and thus provably random.\n\nAll code to display the art is stored immutably on chain forever (except p5js library) and mirrored on IPFS.\n\nAfter 30 days, minting will be disabled and unclaimed art will be generated and burned, lost until the end of time.\n\nMade by ab with love. Each Filament was minted for free (+gas), and limited to a single person via ENS whitelist. There is no website.",
