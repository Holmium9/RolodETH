  "description": "The Azuki Twin Tigers Jacket is inspired by 'Sukajan' jackets, an all-time classic fashion piece dating back to the 1940s that combines American & Japanese street culture. We've put our own twist on the jacket, which symbolizes the solidarity of the Azuki garden. This reversible jacket features quilted Japanese silk in blue and red.\r\n\r\nEach Azuki holder was previously airdropped a Twin Tigers Jacket token, which could be used to redeem a physical jacket by the deadline of August 18, 2022. The jacket claim window is now closed.\r\n\r\nAll royalties from the secondary market trading of the Azuki Twin Tigers Jacket token will go towards supporting Stand With Asians, an AAPI-focused community fund.",
