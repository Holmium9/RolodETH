  "description": "With the launch of Curry partner Serums, we go from changing the game to mutating the game. Our Serums, from some of the most exciting communities in the Metaverse, are designed to produce some truly game-winning results when brought together with the Curry NF3 Basketball. While the traits are transparent, how they mutate is really the fun part of this project, adding rarity, collectability, and surprise. So how will you mutate the game? \n\nFollow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bball_headz) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/currybrand) for real-time updates.",
