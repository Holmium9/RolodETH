  "description": "THE KILLA' is the story of those who removed the walls! The story of those who are no longer behind the walls..\n\nsome killas like to kill at night.. some during the day.. do they do it to hide? I don't think so mate.. the depths of some are revealed at night.. because night makes people more free.. the night falls on people like a curtain and provides a private space for everyone.\n\nbut those who kill during the day are more terrible. they are the cruelest. one comes to mind... veteran. No, no, the veteran is the last person I want to meet.",
