  "description": "RRMAYC is here to spread awareness of antisemitism. WEB3 has undeniably provided us, community leaders, with a larger outreach to our listeners/readers. By creating a project under the Ethereum blockchain we are simultaneously alerting multiple groups at once. Since the BAYC launch, we have always suspected something was off. Not only with the art, but with the founders behind the project itself. I spent 26 years of my life living in Jerusalem, and to see a company/brand/project with such a large influence on the NFT market, supporting racism and hatred towards the Jewish people IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. By releasing the project RRMAYC we are hoping to alert many people who are not aware of the situation that is presented. BAYC is a monopoly and it should not be ignoring the allegations that are being thrown at them.\r\nRRMAYC will use the funds given by the community to spread awareness of racism all across the border.",
