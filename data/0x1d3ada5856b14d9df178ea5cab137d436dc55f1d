  "description": "Deathbats Club is a collection of 10,000 unique Deathbat NFT’s, made popular by Avenged Sevenfold,  flying around the Ethereum blockchain.   Your Deathbat is your membership card into the club and offers many perks and events which will take place in the “metaverse” and in real life.  The band even threw in ownership rights to your deathbat so we look forward to seeing your creativity.  Inside the collection many 1/1 experiences are hidden and can be redeemed at [avengedsevenfold.io](https://avengedsevenfold.io).  Please join the discord or visit the site for more info.
