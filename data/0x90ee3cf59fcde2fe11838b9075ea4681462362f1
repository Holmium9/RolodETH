  "description": "The Non-Fungible Fungi are a 10K collection of unique 3D animated Mushrooms strolling across the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEach Mushroom falls into 1 of 3 species; Magic, Mire-able and Bog Standard with Magic being the rarest and our Bog's being the most abundant. The Genesis shrooms provide us with the grandfather traits and from there we have a multitude of different traits ranging both in rarity and looks which gives us the 10,000 Generative Collection.\n\ndiscord.gg/fungiblefungi",
