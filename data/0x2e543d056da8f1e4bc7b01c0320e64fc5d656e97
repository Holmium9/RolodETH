This IS the future of gaming, and ArcadeNFTs are continuing to pioneer this space. We started making history in August of 2021 with the release of the first ever NFT video game on-chain, our Genesis Pinball NFT, and we are excited to announce the release of the MetaDragonz which is the first game to launch in our proprietary Arcade Arena.\n\nThe Arcade Arena is a first of its kind own smart contract created specifically for p2e and pvp gaming in the metaverse where ranking, prizes, and payments will all be controlled and fulfilled by our smart contract.",
