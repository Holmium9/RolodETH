  "description": "[EightBit](https://www.eightbit.me) is a collection of 8,888 NFTâ€™s that are generated by countless 8-bit themed traits. Within the collection, there are rare outfits, items, and more surprises.\r\n\r\nEach NFT contains a PFP and a full Digital EightBit Character which are stored on IPFS. All characters have their own page ([see example](https://www.eightbit.me/bit/7030)) that will become more interactive in time.\r\n\r\nBack in 2010, we launched the original 8-bit avatar creator. Before a world of punks and apes, our app let you make a virtual 8-bit version of yourself. Check out it out in action [here](https://vimeo.com/20713468).",
