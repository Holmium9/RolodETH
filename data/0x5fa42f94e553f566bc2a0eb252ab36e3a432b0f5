  "description": "Onchain Block Invaders (OBI) is a 100% generated and stored on-chain evolvable pfp collection with swappable skins and color palettes.\r\n\r\nThe custom contracts support uploading future assets, directly on-chain, that collectors can use to change their skins and palettes without impacting the rarity system. These are not new NFTs, 1 OBI = up to 32 skins and 32 color palettes that can be combined in 1024 variations.\r\n\r\nOBI supports uploading new contracts tied to the existing collection containing new render techniques and on-chain mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe story-driven collection is doubled by a BOLD-SIMPLE-INCLUSIVE design, starting from prime shapes that mixed together offer a distinctive graphical line.",
