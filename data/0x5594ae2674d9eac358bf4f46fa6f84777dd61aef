  "description": "DNA chips contain the DNA or traits of an evolved [Anonymice Baby](https://opensea.io/collection/anonymice-babies) displayed in the hologram.   \r\n\r\nPod fragments can be obtained by participating in weekly on-chain [salvage events](https://anonymice.com/evolutions) with your mice.   \r\n\r\nOne DNA chip and three pod fragments are required to assemble a full evolution pod.   An evolution pod will contain the same DNA from the DNA chip used to assemble it and is downloaded and displayed on the computer screen ready for a baby mouse.   \r\n\r\nAn Anonymice Baby can enter an evolution pod and come out with the new traits displayed on the screen. The evolved baby mouse will remain in the [Anonymice Baby](https://opensea.io/collection/anonymice-babies) collection and be stamped on the blockchain forever. \r\n\r\nJoin our discord to learn more!",
