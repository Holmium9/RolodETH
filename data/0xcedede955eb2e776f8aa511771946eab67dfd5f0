  "description": "It Was Always The Eyes is a series conveying the message of silent understanding. When you meet a person who’s been through a lot, I think quite often you can see the sentiment of their past in their eyes. Most of us protect ourselves by wearing a “mask” (some do so more strongly than others), but the eyes of a person barely ever deceive. It Was Always The Eyes, strips away that mask and focuses fully on just the eyes. Even in a deceptively simple art piece, the result is quite powerful. Somehow allowing a lot of emotions to come crashing through. Art is fully on chain.",
