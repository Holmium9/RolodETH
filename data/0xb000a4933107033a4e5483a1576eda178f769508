It is a knowing look, a tip of the hat, a secret handshake that says: we're here to build the best future possible. \r\n\r\nTajigen holders are able to enter The Shelter: an exclusive hub of founders, builders, designers and developers at the forefront of web3 & DeFi, and access future experiences outlined in our concept map.\r\n\r\nWe are the creators of TinyERC721, a hyper gas-optimized NFT contract.\r\n\r\nVisit [tajigen.xyz](https://www.tajigen.xyz) to find out more.",
