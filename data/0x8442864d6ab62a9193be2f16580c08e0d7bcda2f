TIMEPieces airdropped the NFT issue to select TIMEPiece and LIT community wallet holders, which was made possible with the support of Circle. Transient Labs served as the project’s technical partner.\r\n\r\n[View License Agreement](https://time.com/privacy/timepieces_license_agreement.html)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/timepieces) | [Discord](http://discord.gg/timepieces)"
