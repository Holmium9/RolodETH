  "description": "Rigs is a generative collection built from 1,074 handcrafted works of art for the builders and creatives of cyberspace. Rigs are built on the Tableland protocol, a decentralized read, write, and own database for relational, composable dataâ€”powered by smart contracts and SQL on EVM chains like Ethereum. Rigs are your ticket to rewards for builders, creatives, ambassadors, and believers in Tableland.",
