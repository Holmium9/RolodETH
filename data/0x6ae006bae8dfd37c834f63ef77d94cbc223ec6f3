  "description": "Creepy World NFTs is a 02 Volume Satire Collection of Creepy Costumes trying to survive their sh*tty ass job. The collection is presented by Larry, a character performer who is not exactly happy about his own life, especially due to his exhausting work at the theme park — the (bankrupt) Creepy World. \n\nIt is inspired by 90’s cartoons and is essentially a satire on Amusement parksand the duality between the Magic and happiness they sell or propose by its facade and what really stands behind the curtains. Comically designed with traces of acid humor, it all started after a talk between myself and our artist, about Summer Jobs in theme parks.",
