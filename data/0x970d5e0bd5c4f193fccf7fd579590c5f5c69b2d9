  "description": "The Fortune Dao Genesis (FDG) is an NFT collection spawned from the mind of the NFT Aerfa community, with synergistic utilities of PFP, membership and toolbox access. The collection consists of 666 art pieces that are inspired by the God of Fortune with a modern fashion statement. Each piece has its own traits and rarity and will be eventually programmed into a reactive NFT that constantly monitors and responds to the NFT market by changing facial expressions.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://aerfa.io\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NFT_Aerfa\r\n\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/nftaerfa",
