  "description": "The E-Bot Cyber Club is home to 5,233 digital NFT companions. This project aims to create an interactive, \"cross platform assistant\" that can aid you with your daily activities. Think R2D2 for Luke Skywalker and the Windows 98 Paperclip meet Web 3! \n\nAn IRL E-Bot Assistant Prototype has been developed and can be seen on Youtube here https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fzfhJ4jDX1c. This E-Bot Assistant Prototype houses a Google Home Mini, Raspberry Pi, Programmable LEDs, and a battery bank and charging system inside a 3d printed body. There are plans to further develop this IRL Prototype and integrate Ai technology, Web 3 and blockchain technology, and a host of additional features to allow our holders to interact with their NFT characters, both in the digital world, and in real life! \n\nAnyone willing to join the development teams should come to our discord and get involved! Everyone is welcome to apply and there are no expectations. Come join this STEM project and show us your skills!",
