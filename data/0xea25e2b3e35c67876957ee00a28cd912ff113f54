  "description": "TheLandSafe is a utility-focused NFT collection with a burning mechanism that builds value for holders while making the project deflationary. The Treasury is focused on strategically acquiring land and other assets in established and newly established Metaverses (such as OtherDeeds, Sandbox, WordwideWebb3, Decentraland, etc.). \n\nAs a community, our job is to find the best possible assets to generate value for our holders for years to come.\n\nDue to the burning mechanism, actual supply is 8,751 since 137 lands have been permanently burned.\n\nLearn more: https://thelandsafe.gitbook.io/the-landdao/welcome/what-is-thelandsafe",
