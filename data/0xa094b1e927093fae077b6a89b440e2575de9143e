The Spritely team has pledged a total of 20 ETH split between Girls Who Code and Americans for the Arts.\n\nSprites are generated from hundreds of unique mystical traits. Some Sprites hold secret powers and riddles to be solved. Follow the clues to claim untold treasures!\n\nCompete with fellow Sprites in the Spritely Arcade, featuring three web games coming 2022. *Games within the arcade reward SHINE tokens. There is no staking involved & simply holding a Sprite does not guarantee SHINE accumulation.
