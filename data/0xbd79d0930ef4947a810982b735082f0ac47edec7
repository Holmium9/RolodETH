  "description": "[Legends of the FirstBorne](https://thefirstborne.wtf) is a community driven novel where NFT holders contribute ideas and vote on the direction the story takes.\n\nThe novel is funded by a collection of 11,111 unique NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAll NFT collectors hold a seat at The Round Table, where they can contribute ideas to our team of story writers at any time.\n\nAll ideas will be considered and if any are written into the story, the contributors will receive a mention in the novel credits.\n\nPivotal moments in the story will be voted on by members of The Round Table, so they can pick the path they want the story to lead.\n\nThis truly is a community driven project, and will set the benchmark for all other NFT projects in the future.",
