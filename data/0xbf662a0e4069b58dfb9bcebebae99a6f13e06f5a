  "description": "The Toy Boogers collection is 100% handmade and not programmatically generated. All 3,333 NFTs are 1/1 original pieces of artwork created by Doug, the creator and founder of Toy Boogers. \n\nThe Backstory: The year was 2021 when a group of NFT degens started developing special teleportation technology to physically transport themselves into the metaverse. The development was rushed in excitement and somehow a booger got stuck on the machineâ€™s focusing crystal. Little did they know, this would cause a critical (but delightful) malfunction. When they used the machine, they got combined and rearranged with all the crazy avatars in their collections as they teleported into the metaverse. They became an epic NFT collection themselves called Toy Boogers.\n\nThe Toy Boogers collection consists of 3,333 unique NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain, stored as ERC-721 tokens, and hosted on IPFS.",
