  "description": "What's in a Mystery Sneaker Box? Of course, you won't know until you open it, but one thing's for sure â€“ you'll find some pretty incredible surprises from The Hype Section, including sneakers, sports cards, exclusive merch collabs, and NFT drops.\r\n\r\nWHO WE ARE: \r\nOur passion for sneakers, streetwear, and technology inspired us to create a globally recognized Web3 brand that bridges the gap between the physical world and the Metaverse. But, we're more than a sneaker store; our mission is to drive sneakerhead culture forward by creating NFTs with real-world utility and purpose, so they're more than just digital collectibles. The new era of flex is here.\r\n\r\nThe Hype Section is owned by Carlos Gil and Reggie Williams, successful entrepreneurs with significant experience in brand and community building, including marketing, e-commerce, professional sports, and entertainment backgrounds.",
