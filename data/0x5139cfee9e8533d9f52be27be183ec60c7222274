  "description": "Wizards of Etheen is based on the wizarding world of Etheen - home to the most powerful magic in the cosmos: Ether. Etheen has been hidden from the wizarding universe for centuries out of fear Ether would be used for evil, but the spell hiding the world has been broken. Now, other wizarding worlds are finding their way to Etheen to plunder the Ether mines.\n\nFollow the lore by using the wizard dashboard - an application that houses all your wizards and their stats. As you perform quests with your wizards (in the spirit of \"choose your own adventures\") you will be rewarded XP for learning about Etheen, helping fellow Etheen wizards, and defeating evil. As your wizard grows, you'll also be able to learn new spells and attacks for battle.\n\nDrops are already in the works, and the next challengers are the wizards from the world of Mozool. See Twitter for previews and updates!\n\nFOR ETHEEN!",
