  "description": "KODACHROME is built from a collection of 100+ previously exposed rolls of film from bygone eras spanning approximately 1945-1995. The film has come from various sources - thrift stores, flea markets, estate sales and more. Each exposure will be chemically developed in a lab, reimagined as a new work of digital art, and stored on the blockchain forever under new stewardship.",
