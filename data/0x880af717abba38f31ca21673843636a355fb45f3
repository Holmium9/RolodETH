  "description": " ‘Drip Drop’ is a cohesive collection of 1111 1/1 photography NFTs by New York based photographer Dave Krugman. This collection is an ode to generative art from projects like Art Blocks, inspired by works such as Chromie Squiggles, Fidenzas, and Ringers. To learn more about this project, visit the Drip Drop website on ALLSHIPS and join the Dave Krugman Discord. \n\n100 mints are held for future. \n\n‘Drip Drop’ is a study of the generative beauty of the universe, as viewed through the lens of rain hitting puddles in Times Square. Color spectrums emerge from bright billboards, and wash over textured water, highlighting the beauty at the intersection of nature and civilization. At the overlap of these worlds, gorgeous patterns emerge. Each Drip is a slide to be studied- a cross section of entropy and energy. \n\n‘Drip Drop’ is a collaboration between Dave Krugman and Transient Labs. The team built a custom machine vision algorithm that sorts and batches Drips based on their emergent rarities. ",
