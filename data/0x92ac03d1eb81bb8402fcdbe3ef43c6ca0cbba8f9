  "description": "Fear City is a collection of 3,333 unique masterpieces, 6 formidable characters, each with their own story to tell.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Fear City, where menacing gangs and corrupt politicians vie for control of Fear City. Fear City is born out of Stephen Blissâ€™ (the artist responsible for the iconic Grand Theft Auto illustrations) creative expression. The goal is to use the power of Web3 technology to bring the dark and beautiful metaverse of Fear City to life in comic books, animated series, video games and much, much more. Each Fear City character is a key to the Fear City intellectual property, exclusive merch, digital and IRL events, and will unlock even more utility and surprises.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your stay in Fear City.",
