  "description": "ATTENTION: The floor may be higher than it appears to be. This is because of our non-escrow staking contract, which allows people to stake their tokens without sending them to an escrow wallet. This means that staked tokens can be listed for sale here on OpenSea but not purchased. This could in turn create the illusion that the floor is lower than it is in actuality. All staked tokens will be clearly labeled! \r\n\r\nThe Lost SamuRise is a faction based strategy game played in the fictional world of Tengoku (heaven) that has borrowed lore and stylistic elements from Samurai culture in classical Japan. Our game will take place on L2 arbitrum. \r\n\r\nTotal supply: 10,020",
