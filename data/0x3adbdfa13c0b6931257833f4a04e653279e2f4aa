  "description": "Versailles Heroes is an evolutionary GameFi project that redefined the NFTs in blockchain games.\r\n\r\nFirstly, different types of NFTs such as NFT heroes and NFT weapons increase the earning potential of each player in the game. In addition, NFT bonus rewards are accessible to every NFT holder regardless of the outcome of a game.\r\n\r\nSecondly, inspired by the leveling system in traditional games, Versailles Heroes introduces the concept of upgradable and scalable NFTs. Every upgrade will make your NFT heroes more powerful in combat and add more battle counts to earn more rewards. The more you win with an NFT, this NFT will gain a higher proficiency level which will yield you more bonus rewards when you win.\r\n\r\nBoth upgrade data and game win data are recorded on the blockchain to ensure the uniqueness of each NFT.",
