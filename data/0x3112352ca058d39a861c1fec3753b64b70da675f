  "description": "The OG Portal collection consists of 969 golden PFPs that provide over 4ETH in annual value and lets holders flex their identity as an early supporter of the EktaChain network. Annual value is derived from utilities ranging from Ekta Real Estate NFT offerings to Ekta Island benefits and Ekta Fashion collections.\nOG Portals also gives you a free mint for the Ekta Portal collection which ensures a Portal Node device is shipped to holders for free. The Portal Node earns users crypto rewards for providing endpoint node services for the EktaChain network. Ekta Portals is also the only way to whitelist for Ekta Island NFTs which gives access and utility in the worldâ€™s first degen island near Bali, built for degens by degens.",
