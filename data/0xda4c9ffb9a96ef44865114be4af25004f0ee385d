  "description": "Moodies by Hanuka is a 7,401-piece celebration of emotional complexity from Award-Winning Artists Asaf and Tomer Hanuka.\n\nMoodies by Hanuka is the first ever Fine Art PFP and the first ever emotional mint: pay what you feel.\n\nThere are 32 pure souls in the collection that each come with a signed print. The 32 pure souls are the building blocks of the entire collection.\n\nMoodies by Hanuka is a culture shock, a paradigm shift in the way we talk about and allow ourselves to be comfortable with our thoughts, emotions, and feelings.\n\nIt’s a mess to be human… but it’s also beautiful. \n\nWelcome to Moodies by Hanuka. #WEAREALLMOODIES #WAGMOOD",
