  "description": "TOKYO PUNKS BY SABET | TokyoPunks.com\nART IS THE UTILITY. LOVE IS THE ROADMAP.\n4850 HAND PAINTED, ORGANICALLY GENERATED NFTS\nInspired by Ali Sabet’s first trip with his family to Tokyo at a very young age in the 1980’s during the street punk movement. “Seeing real Punks on the streets of Tokyo fundamentally changed the way I see color, shape and form. The wild mohawk wearing punks were something out of this world. The clothing, the vibrant colors, leather and spikes!! These images were seared in my brain for the rest of my life.” Sabet",
