Each of the 5,500 Genesis Dino Babies allows its holder to participate in the Dino Babies in Space community treasury and vote on every aspect of the show’s production. By owning a Ziggy, you’re taking part in the full creation process of the next animated action-comedy.\n\nCheck out all the parts of the project below: Honey Brasco Space Pirates\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/honeybrascospacepirates",
