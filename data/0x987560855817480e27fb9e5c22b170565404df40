  "description": "Before they came together to wow non-fungible-fans, The PUNKS were leading their own individual lives until they were called to the only place to be in web3: Origin City! Follow along with Origin Stories, a digital-only short comic exploring the backgrounds of Courtney, GFunk, and the stars of PUNKS (and their peers), peeling back the layers of who they are, uncovering the alpha that got them to the top, and learning what brought them all together. Who knows, maybe weâ€™ll even learn that Wiggles has a secret or two in his past?",
