  "description": "In the beginning, X7 was a stranger. Information was scarce. Speculation was high. A small number of DeFi pioneers found the messages and vision emanating from the blockchain compelling.\n\nThese pioneers took a leap of faith and supported the project.\n\nAs thanks, each one of these pioneers has been airdropped a single X7 Pioneer NFT.\n\nIn perpetuity the holder of an X7 Pioneer NFT can withdraw ETH from a reward pool. The reward pool is funded through the various revenue streams in the X7 ecosystem. It will receive 6% of the profit from the ecosystem.\n\nAny pioneer wishing to sell their NFT must pay an unlock fee of 0.07 ETH to permanently unlock the NFT for transfers.\n\nIf you are a pioneer, thank you!\nIf you are a new explorer that has found your way to these NFTs, welcome!",
