  "description": "Let's build a community of supporters for the Giga initiative (https://gigaconnect.org/) and raise funds to bring reliable, robust connectivity to schools across the globe. UNICEF, ITU and Snowcrash Labs have partnered with data visualization scientist, designer and artist Nadieh Bremer. Bremer effectively ‘paints’ with data that Giga has collected from schools themselves, creating a unique and visually striking collection of 1,000 NFTs called the Patchwork Kingdoms (https://www.patchwork-kingdoms.com/). These works are inspired by real information about school connectivity, which you can see on Giga's Project Connect site (www.projectconnect.world).",
