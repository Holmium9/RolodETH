  "description": "In the crumbling, fetid streets of Zero Valley, the electric thrill of copium fills the air. Out of the piles of rotting trash, mysterious beings coalesce, and dance in joyful circles, awaiting the coming of Zero, when all we built becomes worthless.\n\nIntroducing, the Rotten Anti Social Club. 9,582 animated piles of garbage, disgracing the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTheir only utility is that they stink to high heaven. They promise nothing. They are too disgusting for Discord, and roam the cesspit of Twitter. Art by Dario De Siena",
