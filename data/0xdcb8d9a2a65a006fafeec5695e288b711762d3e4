  "description": "🔹Phase 1: Gold cards, 0.5 floor, 0.02% listed. Phase 2: Silver cards, main floor, BIG announcement coming soon! 🚀\n\n🔹HEXGO™️ was created to bring the entire NFT industry together. We have built one of the biggest and strongest NFT collaborative ecosystems, partnered with over 150+ NFT projects, and created a powerful utility NFT network that welcomes all NFT projects to join. \n\n🔹We are the FIRST and ONLY 50/50 organization building together! 50% of the mint, and 50% of the royalties go to the Hexgo member's vault. The vault buys NFTs from our partners and gives them away as gifts in our exciting contests every week. This allows our members to collect and join other great NFT communities.\n\n🔹Membership includes six utilities: Hexgo vault, Hexgo alpha club, Hexgo rewards club, Hexgo NFT ecosystem, Hexgo API portal, and the Hexgo meta pass.
