  "description": "Cascade by TinkRNG is a novel, biologically-inspired generative art project portraying patterns in the human proteome. Each piece represents a unique protein, with properties derived from information including the proteinâ€™s amino acid sequence, the cellular compartment where the protein localizes to, and the primary biological process that the protein is involved in.\n\nTo learn more, please read our [White Paper](https://medium.com/@tinkrng/cascade-by-tinkrng-6f20bccfbf1d) as well as our [second publication](https://medium.com/@tinkrng/chalk-talk-exploring-the-biological-processes-that-underly-cascade-by-tinkrng-d87337004ba8). \n\nOur Cascade Genesis collection can be found on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/cascade-genesis-by-tinkrng) as well as [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@tinkRNG) where it was originally auctioned.
