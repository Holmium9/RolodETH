  "description": "**UNSTAKE ALL ASSETS IMMEDIATELY in preparation for Orbit 2 Gameplay!**\n\n\n**Shattered Eon is an ever-expanding, ever-unfolding Sci-Fi Space Epic. A 100% on-chain Colonist and Pirate NFT universe full of consequential decision making and p2p interaction.**\n\nInhabitants of the Shattered Eon Universe have the freedom to build a mining team to gather Eonite riches, assemble a Pirate armada to run the darker side, or even focus efforts on a single Colonist and tell the story of their life and adventures on the planet Pytheas. All paths are open to ascend to the interior.\n\nGen0 asset holder airdrop happening in the near future! If you own and hold any Gen0 asset, you will receive an ARPS (Land/Base) for each unique ID you have!\n\n---\n[ShatteredEon.io](https://www.ShatteredEON.io)\n---\n\n[Shards & Onosia](https://opensea.io/collection/imperialguild)|[rEON](https://opensea.io/collection/shatteredeon-rawresources)|[Pirates](https://opensea.io/collection/shatteredeon-pirates)\n",
