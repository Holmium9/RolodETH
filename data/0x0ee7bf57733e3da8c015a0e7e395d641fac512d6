  "description": "!BOO The Oni Squad collection consists of 6,666 spooky & friendly ghosts randomly generated from 240 hand-drawn traits (some of which are extra rare!). Onis are minted, stored, and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nOni Squad released its first game Oni Mansion, where these clever ghosts haunted the mansions across chains! Our freaky friends are training for future fun, including a P&E game scheduled for Q2 2022. Befriending an Oni (adding one to your squad) gives you access/utility to upcoming P&E games!\n\nSpecial Edition Oni Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/onisquadse  \n\nBaby Spirit (Polygon):  https://opensea.io/collection/baby-spirits-oni-squad",
