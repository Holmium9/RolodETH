  "description": "DNA is a new ‘living’ NFT collection based on users’ on-chain activity that is generated when users create a Zerion Wallet. This NFT will change over time according to the amount of gas you’ve spent, the amount of assets you hold, the networks you support and more! DNA holders can set their NFTs as their wallet avatars and visually express their on-chain activity. Zerion’s mission is to connect 1 Billion people to Web3 and the DNA is about giving users a way to express themselves on-chain.\n\nTo claim your DNA, create a Zerion Wallet via our Zerion iOS and Android apps.\n\nOther NFT collections from Zerion: [Zerion Genesis](https://opensea.io/collection/zerion-genesis-collection)",
