  "description": "Rivermen is a gamified NFT collection based on blockchain technology, created by the Cthuwork&NA team using elements from the voxel version of the “Along the River During Qingming Festival”. The voxel version of “Along the River During Qingming Festival” is a 3D artwork reinterpreting this long scroll, as one of the top ten famous Chinese paintings.\nThe RIVER refers to the \"Bian River\" in this ancient painting scroll. Each person in this scene has a unique identity. The Rivermen are the good neighbors and cool folks living in the \"Bianriverse\".\nThey are not ancient nor modern, but aboriginal people of the \"Bianriverse\", which is a metaverse based on \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\". They will spend some quality time together in the Bianriverse.\nRiverSpace：https://opensea.io/collection/river-space\nRiverEstate：https://opensea.io/collection/riverestate\nRiverArt：https://opensea.io/collection/riverart\nRivermenGift：https://opensea.io/collection/rivermengift",
