  "description": "A collection of S7NS STATION Genesis NFTs that give you ticket access to The Station Of Sins. With Stakeholder System, the first dynamic minting smart contract: ERC721-S7, and an innovative airdropping smart contract, S7NS STATION will provide passengers with utilities from various sources. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe seven deadly sins - pride, envy, anger, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust are the inspirations for the artwork. The boundaries between the digital and biblical worlds are becoming hazier, and new regulations are emerging.",
