Each OG:Crystal transformed and grew every time it was purchased from another collector. The facets and contours of each piece were generated algorithmically, according to each owner's crypto wallet history. \n\nAfter all the crystals were \"locked\" into their permanent form, the project entered the final and most ambitious road map stage. 3D Crystals will soon evolve into Crystal REEF — a massive physical sculpture that will be shown in highly respected museums and galleries worldwide. \n\nOG:CR is a collaboration between artists Michael Joo (ASomatica) and Danil Krivoruchko (Myshli) with the technical support of Snark.art. \nThe collection inspired an even more ambitious and large-scale art project — [OG.Art platform](https://og.art)",
