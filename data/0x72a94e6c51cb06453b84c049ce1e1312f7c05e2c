  "description": "Wiiides get wider when they are sold or transferred between wallets. Wiiides is an experimental smart contract and conceptual artwork by Sterling Crispin, no affiliation with Yuga Labs or Larva Labs. See https://twitter.com/wiiides and http://www.wiiides.com for more info and terms of service. \r\n\r\nWiiides are a fully on chain artwork, meaning all data and artwork are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Wiiides consume data directly from the on chain CryptoPunks, and programmatically edit the data to make each image grow wider and wider, based on the growth rate of each Wiiide and the number of transfers. \r\n\r\nTen percent of the proceeds will be donated to charities focused on helping survivors of domestic violence.",
