  "description": "The RTFKT x RIMOWA Meta-Artisan Collection ðŸŒŒ\r\n\r\nEncompassing a new collection of NFTs, limited-edition luggage and a robot collectible, the new collaboration brings to life â€”and to the Metaverseâ€” the ultimate experience for RIMOWA enthusiasts and Web3 collectors. Combining their respective craftsmanship, RTFKT and RIMOWA have come together to create a RTFKT x RIMOWA limited edition Original Cabin Luggage, with only 888 pieces produced â€“ a nod to the luck associated with the number in the web3 world.\r\n\r\nAlongside the digital and physical iterations of the Cabin Luggage, there are 2222 NFTs of a robot collectible. Designed by RTFKT, the NFT takes the form of a space WorkerBot, The Wandersmithâ€™s trusted assistant, within the RTFKT x RIMOWA universe."
