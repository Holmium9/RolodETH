  "description": "The Axelar Robot Collection launched as a fixed set of 2,000 NFTs in September of 2022. The collection is inspired by Axelar's robot mascot, an advanced sentient being on a universal quest to unite all blockchains. The collection was created in partnership with MintDAO, a native cross-chain NFT launchpad. NFT holders can bridge their robots across different chains to participate in cross-chain hunts and win rewards.",
