  "description": "The first 3D PFP generated on-chain. \n199X is Spectra.art's official PFP, our love letter to the 90s, and our most ambitious project yet.\n\nIn true Spectra fashion, the project is also an NFT first! Each Avatar is a 3D model rendered using our custom on-chain 3D graphics software, Shackled.\n\nEvery NFT includes:\n1. A 3D model, so that in time you can use your Avatar in your favorite Metaverses and games.\n2. A 2D on-chain render to use as a PFP.\n3. A wireframe render, which you can use to give your PFP a unique look.",
