  "description": "Deez is a global ecosystem of Meme loving nutty humans frothing over a 10,000 PFP Collection.\n\n﻿\nShop ﻿Deez ﻿is a collection of NFT attributes our holders can own by using their $NUTS coin from our Back ﻿Stage. Shop items are also accessible for re-sale on the secondary market (right here) - but only if the holder is willing to give their item up.\n\n﻿\n﻿Some items are unique, some are rare, some come with utility and others are just super dope - But all are limited in supply and once sold out in the shop, they will not be re-stocked. ﻿Simply put, all shop items are a fun attribute, currently only to the OG Deez Nuts.",
