  "description": "[Play to Mint Now!](https://duskbreakers.gg/egg/mint) Part of the DuskBreakers collection, The Gribbles are a mysterious collective of hive mind insectoids that have made an alien spaceship their home away from home. These intergalactic stowaways begin life as an adorable egg, but donâ€™t stay that way for long. A gribble evolves from an egg to its fully evolved 3D form with proper incubation and care. The more care received, the stronger and more radiant a gribble can become. \n\nWild gribbles ferociously defend their hive against invasion, while those raised by Breakers make wonderful companions and love to play. You and your gribble companion will be able to make indelible memories in the many adventures that lie ahead.",
