  "description": "The URS Project is a revolutionary 3d animated collection of 10K avatars that live on the Ethereum blockchain, created by a team of elite and world class Korean artists. In 2130, while humanity was forced underground, URS (Underground Robogenetic Survivalists) were created to access the warpgates which connected to the earthâ€™s scorched surface and gather essential supplies. Each URS is a high quality 3d animated video while also serving as an entry into a community and roadmap that includes free mints for holders, merchandise, metaverse items and games, and more. https://opensea.io/collection/urscompanions",
