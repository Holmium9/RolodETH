  "description": "The PUMA Materializer is the physical twin to PUMAâ€™s digital Nitro Collection. Each Materializer NFT represents a physical pair of shoes that can be claimed in 2023. Each Materializer NFT has a shoe style (NFRNO or Fastroid) and size associated with that NFT.\n\nBoth designs were developed with the metaverse in mind. Designed first in 3D and tested in augmented reality before physical samples were ever created. The physical products are a first-of-their-kind experiment with new materials, technology, and design.\n\nNitro Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/nitrocollectionpuma",
