  "description": "Decentraland is an Ethereum blockchain-powered virtual world, developed and owned by its users, who can create, experience, and monetize content and applications. Decentraland Names are tradable ERC721s, integrated fully with the Ethereum Name System. These unique human-readable names allow users to trade tokens between memorable addresses, e.g. ‘jane.dcl.eth’. In this OpenSea store, you can buy and sell Decentraland Names in MANA, DCL's native currency.",
