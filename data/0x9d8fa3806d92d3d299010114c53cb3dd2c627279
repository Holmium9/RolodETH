  "description": "Lofi Guy is an on going collectible art & music project by artist Cody A Banks and music producer L.Dre. It consists of unique animations of the Lofi Guy character perfectly synced with original lofi hip hop instrumentals. This is not a generative project. Each Lofi Guy is hand made with love by the creators.\n\nThe style changes but the signature head bop remains the same.\n\n[Lofi Guy Specials](https://opensea.io/collection/lofi-guy-specials) // [Lofi Littles](https://opensea.io/collection/lofi-littles)",
