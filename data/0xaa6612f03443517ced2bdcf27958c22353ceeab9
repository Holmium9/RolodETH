  "description": "🎍🎍 BAMBOOZLERS GARDEN 🎍🎍 CURRENT POPULATION: 5,274 🎍🎍\n\nYears ago in a metaverse far away, an interspatial meteorite slammed into the pandaverse. The blast affected ~3000 pandas in the radius, causing them to grow more intelligent, suave and experimental. \n\nFollowing their transformation, the affected pandas congregated in the most prestigious  bamboo valley residing near Gooch Mountain. They became so much more intelligent that unaffected pandas shunned them, labeling them Bamboozlers. They eventually built a suave bamboo wall around their valley...the area now referred to as Bamboozlers Garden.\n\nThe Bamboozlers got so intelligent they started experimenting with alchemy and learned how to transmute new Bamboozlers through what they call \"gm\" (generative-manifestation).  They managed 2274 successful gm's....4726 transmutations caught fire and burned\n\nBamboozlers have built an Experimental group testing new transmutations and exploring what other vibes the metaverse has to offer.
