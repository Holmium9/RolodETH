  "description": "Exploring the concepts of chaos, fungibility and the fractal nature of abstract paint layers dragged onto canvas, a scale is an individual artwork, wholly unique, yet an equal microcosm of a greater work. \r\n\r\nEvery Scale is a 1 of 1 and exists as both partial, and full ownership of a complete artwork. Created by subdividing canvasses into individual parcels, Scales democratize ownership of Annas work across many collectors. \r\n\r\nWith a new drop of 500-1000 pieces scheduled for release every month, a total of 10,000 scales will be minted. â€‹Collect 4 in a row (across or down) to be admitted into the Royalty Club, where members divide up a pool of 5% royalties on the entire collection.\r\n\r\nEach Scale is 4600x4600px",
