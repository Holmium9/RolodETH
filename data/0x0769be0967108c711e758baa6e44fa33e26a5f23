  "description": "[ONE DECOMPOSES, THREE MORE ARE SPAWNED](https://orangecomet.com/collection/twd-lands-degenerative-walkers/)\r\n\r\nTHE DEGENERATIVE WALKERS are very special. When you buy one, it will decompose over time and generate 3 additional walkers. If you hodl, you will end up owning 4 unique walkers, all based on your first 1 of 1 character. If you sell before all have spawned, the chain doesnâ€™t break: the next buyer will get any remaining airdrops.",
