  "description": "Avastars (est. in Feb. 2020) are generative characters for the metaverse. Each one is unique and has their art and metadata stored on-chain. Avastars come licensed for use commercially by their owners. Collect Avastar Primes to make Replicants with their trait copies. IMPORTANT: When someone uses/burns a trait copy from an Avastar Prime, OpenSea shows “-Burned” after the trait name. ALWAYS CLICK ON A TRAIT TO SEE IF IT’S COPY IS BURNED BEFORE PURCHASE IF THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. There is also a “MINT CONDITION” trait. All Avastars #0-25,199 are Avastar Primes. #25,200+ are Avastar Replicants. You cannot make a Replicant with another Replicant’s traits, and no 2 Avastar Primes or Replicants can ever be the same. You can also see whether an Avastar is a Prime or a Replicant under the “Wave” category. For more info, visit the Avastars Discord.",
